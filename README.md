One of my first uses of TDD in a serious manner

I could have tried to make my abstractions work together without TDD, but decided to give TDD a shot.

While writing the tests does take time, I believe approaching this project with TDD resulted in it taking _less_ time than had I not.

So, tdd is pleasant. The errors are much easier to fix since they're isolated in unit tests, with mocks when necessary.
